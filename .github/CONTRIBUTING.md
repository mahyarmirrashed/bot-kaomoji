# Contributing

**The issue tracker is only for bug reports and enhancement suggestions. If you have a question, please ask it in [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/mahyarmirrashed/bot-kaomoji/discussions) instead of opening an issue â€“ you will get redirected there anyway.**

If you wish to contribute to the Kaomoji codebase or documentation, feel free to fork the repository and submit a pull request. We use ESLint and Prettier to enforce a consistent coding style, so having those set up in your editor of choice is a great boon to your development process.

## Setup

To work on the codebase, please do the following:

1. Fork & clone the repository, and make sure you're on the **main** branch
2. Run `yarn`
3. Code your heart out!
4. [Submit a pull request](https://github.com/mahyarmirrashed/bot-kaomoji/compare) (Make sure you follow the [conventional commit format](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/commitlint/tree/master/%40commitlint/config-conventional))

In the background, Husky will use Git commits to automatically lint your code to ensure that it compiles and adheres to the stylistic standards outlined in the `.prettierrc.json` configuration file.
